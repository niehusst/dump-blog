This website is blog written by Liam Niehus-Staab. I'm a software engineer,
cat lover, ultimate frisbee player, and a vegan (not necessarily in that order).

If you want to know more about the blog, checkout [this post]({% post_url 2022-3-30-why-the-blog %}).

If you want to know more about me, feel free to examine my poorly maintained
website: [niehusstaab.com](https://niehusstaab.com).

Thanks to [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the free jekyll theme [clean blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) for
allowing me to create this website with minimal effort. And thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
for letting me do free hosting for my unprofessional content.

I love free and open source stuff :)
