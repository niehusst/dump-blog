I believe that there's a lesson in everything (yes, actually everything), from the simplest event to intentional education. By lesson, I mean anything that can be
learned, including motor skills and emotional and existential discoveries. 

Many activities (for lack of a better word) contain multiple lessons, even with varying difficulty to learn. Perhaps one of the most classic examples
is reading a book; you may learn or feel one way while reading a book the first time, and you may get something completely different out of it
when reading it a second time or later in life. Like course prerequisites, you may also find that you had to learn one lesson in order to
learn another.

If you disbelieve me, it may be that you already know the lessons that can be learned from whatever counterpoint you have imagined (perhaps just 
taking a walk around the house, for example) so deeply that there doesn't seem to be a lesson. But if you look back, you might find that you already 
learned the lesson long ago and no longer need to interpret the feedback that led you to the lesson initially. (Again, looking at the self-provided
counterpoint of walking, 1 year-old you probably learned quite a bit about motor control from trying to walk around the house.)

Though there is a lesson in everything, you must also be willing to learn it in order to do so. Like being forced to read a book for class, if you
purposely avoid learning, you will likely succeed in doing exactly that. So as a reminder to myself and others, keep your brain peeled for
new lessons in new and old activities alike; who knows what we may learn about ourselves and the world.
