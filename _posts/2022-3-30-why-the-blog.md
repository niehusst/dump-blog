# Why the blog?

I think there's something important about getting your thoughts or ideas
written out. Even if they're unimportant, or random.

Writing helps you organize your thoughts and puts them in a place where you
(or others) can find them; a form of knowledge sharing, potentially even with
your future self. And in a way, it's also a way of immortalizing yourself in
human conciousness, so that your ideas can live on, even if you don't.

I'm definitely not writing this blog for anyone else. I don't plan on posting
regularly, or following a consistent topic or topics. 

I'm writing this blog for me, so that I can share my thoughts in this potentially
empty echo-chamber. If you're here too, welcome; hope you're having a good day.
