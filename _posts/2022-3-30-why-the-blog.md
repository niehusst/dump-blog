I think there's something important about getting your thoughts or ideas
written out. Even if they're unimportant, or random.

Writing helps you organize your thoughts and puts them in a place where you
(or others) can find them; a form of knowledge sharing, potentially even with
your future self. Some think of it as a way of immortalizing yourself in
human conciousness, so that your ideas can live on, even if you don't.
I'm mostly just interested in making sure I don't forget how to express
an idea in a coherent way.

I'm definitely not writing this blog for anyone else. I don't plan on posting
regularly, or following a consistent topic or topics. 

I'm writing this blog for me, so that I can share my thoughts in this potentially
empty echo-chamber. If you're here too, welcome; I hope you're having a good day.
Enjoy this dumping ground for my brain.
