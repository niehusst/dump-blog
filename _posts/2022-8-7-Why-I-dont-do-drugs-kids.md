I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I don't do any drugs.

This isn't because I think drugs and alcohol are inherently evil, I just don't see the point in them. Some people ask me why I don't use drugs
(and I imagine many more wonder), and I'd like to explain in a more extended and thoughtful response than I usually provide. From now on, I'm lumping alcohol and 
any other intoxicating substances into the term "drugs", because they are definitively drugs if not colloquially.

So why does anyone use drugs recreationaly? To have fun, let go of inhibitions, relax, feel good, explore curiosity (as a non-drug user, I expect this list is rather incomplete).
Mostly, it seems to boil down to recreation (big surprise). But I don't need drugs to have a good time. If I want to "lose control" or get loud, I can do that
just fine without the assistance of drugs. I don't feel like I can only have fun or be authentic under the pretense of drug usage, and that sounds like a
miserable existence. In fact, all the effects most people seem to want out of drug usage are superfluous, if not downright undesirable, to me.

I don't understand why anyone would want to use drugs considering both the intended effects and side-effects. Why would you want to lose control of your body and/or mind? 
Lose memory of your limited time alive? Change your personality to one you potentially don't like (e.g. angry drunk)? Kill brain cells and/or stunt your development? Have a hangover?
Many of these things sound very scary to me. Even the more mild effects that I suspect people are really after,
like feeling tipsy and letting go of inhibition, do not sound desirable to me. My inhibitions and limits are my own, and are part of what makes me Me
(although I suspect society had a strong influence on their development), and I don't want to get rid of them. And even if I did wish to rid myself of 
inhibitions, drug usage to temporarily trick myself into changing (in a desirable, or perhaps undesirable, way) would not be a sustainable, long-term solution.
I like being me and don't want to be anyone else.

And lastly, I'm honestly a little afraid of addiction (and the damage to health that comes with it). I tend to be very all-in 
with things I like; I chug drinks (I only drink water
and occasionally juice), I binge TV shows, I get obsessed with video games, I scarf my food. Deep down, I fear that if I tried drugs, my lizard brain might
take control of me, or, at best, I would be unable to stop thinking about it despite conciously not want it. Drug usage just seems like a lose lose situation
to me; either it's horrible and I regret doing it, or it's good and I risk addiction with every continued usage. I am a bit curious what it feels like, 
but I'd rather be curious forever than hooked. For me, it's not worth the risk, no matter how small (since it is definitely non-zero).

I don't care if _you_ do drugs; your life, your choices. Drug usage certainly isn't all negative for everyone. But drugs aren't harmless either,
and I believe that any and all drug usage should be careful and done in a safe environment, or not at all. I personally don't need or want anything
drugs have to offer, so the negatives far outweigh the positives. That's why I don't do drugs.

P.S.
This feels a little preachy as I write it, but my intention is not to chastise or look down on anyone who does enjoy drug usage. This is merely my perception
of drug usage, and how that informs my personal decision not to use them. 

I'm also certain that this post is riddled with misconceptions, but I am certain of enough of my knowledge of drugs and myself that I am confident my 
personal choice would not change even if they were all corrected.
